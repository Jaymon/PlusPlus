# PlusPlus

Objective-C categories. Lots of helper methods I've accumulated over time, in one convenient place so I can include them in multiple projects.


## If I install this pod, what do I get?

Categories, categories everywhere!


## Installation

Use [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PlusPlus"
```


## Troubleshooting

If your project can't find the PlusPlus headers, [this guide should help you fix it](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html#using-the-cocoapods-project).
